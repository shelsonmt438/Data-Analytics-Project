The "US Data Professionals Salary Estimator" aimed to provide insights into salary trends within the data industry, empowering both job seekers and employers to make informed decisions. This project utilized web scraping techniques to gather salary data from platforms like Glassdoor, Indeed, and Times Jobs. Data cleaning and integration ensured the dataset's reliability and consistency, forming the foundation for meaningful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Machine learning models were developed to predict salaries based on factors such as experience, skills, and location, achieving high accuracy and practical value. Finally, the results were visualized through Power BI dashboards, offering interactive insights and facilitating easy exploration of salary trends.
No scope changes occurred during the project, and all deliverables were successfully met as outlined in the Project Charter.
